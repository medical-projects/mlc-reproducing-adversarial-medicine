== Being a Carpentry Instructor ...

[%step]
* reduces time to prepare material +
(shared open-source materials)
* carpentry methods provide relyable teaching methods + 
(self-confidence)
* feedback from co-teachers increases robustness +
(community based teaching)
* career development for young PhDs, PostDocs, Service Staff, RGLs, ...

== Success Stories

(spaces shared)
* increased teaching effectiveness + 
(more time for science)
* community to improve & deliver good teaching
* port methods to other fields (image analysis, ML, ...)
* https://hzdr.de[Helmholtz-Center Dresden-Rossendorf] is willing to participate

=== Costs

* shared among partners
** total: $ 7500 p.a.
** CSBD and HZDR $ 3750 p.a. each
** CSBD Executive Council covers $ 1875
** RGLs of CSBD candidates cover $ 625
* test phase for 1 year for now

=== Instructor Training

[%step]
* 2-3 day online course (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/[material])
* find common video conference room for >2 candidates
* taught remotely
* exercises locally
* certification procedure (sign-off afterwards)
* 2 bootcamps required by each candidate

== Summary

=== The Carpentries

- open, sustainable and modern teaching of computational skills in academia
- looking for individuals at CSBD/HZDR to create a carpentries community in Dresden
- expression of interest to become an instructor from 3.5 CSBD staff +
